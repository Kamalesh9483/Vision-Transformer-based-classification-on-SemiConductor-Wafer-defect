Vision Transformer for Multi-Class Semiconductor Wafer Image Classification

This project applies a Vision Transformer (ViT) model trained from scratch to classify wafer map images from the Multi-Class Semiconductor Wafer Image Dataset on Kaggle.
The dataset contains multiple wafer defect types, making it suitable for deep learning–based pattern recognition and manufacturing quality analysis.

Project Objective:
✔ Build a Vision Transformer model from scratch using PyTorch
✔ Train the model to classify wafer images into multiple defect categories
✔ Evaluate performance using validation metrics
✔ Visualize sample predictions with predicted and ground-truth labels
